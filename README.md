<h1>CS5550 Semester Project</h1>

This is a turn based, multiplayer RPG battle system made for CS 5550. 
The main focus of the project was to learn about how to use websockets.

The most WIP build of the project is located at http://104.131.9.78/.

<h2>Game Instructions:</h2>

First, enter a name for yourself.

Then, attack the monsters as they appear- don't think about the fact that they have families.

<h2>Installation Instructions:</h2>

After pulling, navigate to the directory.

Create a new virtual environment to run the site in:
<code>virtualenv venv </code>

Activate the environment: 
<code>source venv/bin/activate</code>

Install the flask server and the flask-socketio library:

<code>pip install flask</code>

<code>pip install flask-socketio</code>

Run the python app:

<code>python computernetworking.py</code>

Then, the site will be at http://0.0.0.0:5000/. 


I understand that this has holes and bugs and security issues... it was just fun to make for a class.
